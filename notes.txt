Things to add to the process:

- Sorting by tag
- Better formatting
- A way to handle waiting times a bit more visually clearly (e.g. a bar across the whole page)
- Tags for concurrent processes? (Greek letters next to step numbers??)
- TeX support for marking source URLs
- Space for a description above the recipe
- A total of all ingredients used at the top
