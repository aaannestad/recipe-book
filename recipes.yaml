- name: Apple cider vinegar
  course: ingredient
  servings: about 2 cups

  steps:
    - ingredients:
      - item: apple scraps
        qty: 12
        unit: apples worth
      tools:
      - quart jar
      desc: Put about 12 apples' worth of cores and other scraps in a quart jar; squishing them down as much as you can.
    - ingredients:
      - item: water
        qty: 1
        unit: cup
      - item: sugar
        qty: 2
        unit: tbsp
      - item: live vinegar (optional)
        qty: 1
        unit: tbsp
      desc: Mix about a cup of water with 2 tbsp of sugar, then pour over the apple scraps. Add a tablespoon of vinegar from a previous batch or another live vinegar source if you want, for a bit faster maturation and somewhat lower chance of failure. Add water to fill up the rest of the jar, leaving a few inches of space at the top. You may need a fermentation weight or similar tool to keep the scraps all submerged.
    - tools:
      - coffee filter or paper towel
      - rubber band or string or mason jar band
      desc: Cover the jar with a breathable cover, and leave it to sit in a warm place out of sunlight. Wait a few days for it to start to visibly bubble.
    - desc: Once it's visibly bubbling, stir it once a day to oxygenate the water until it stops bubbling---about two weeks or so.
    - tools:
      - mixing bowl or other receptacle
      - cheesecloth or strainer bag
      desc: Once the vinegar stops bubbling, strain the scraps out through a cloth into a bowl. Squeeze the scraps to liberate as much remaining liquid as you can. Discard the scraps.
    - desc: Pour the vinegar back into the jar, cover with a breathable cover, and let it ferment without stirring for another two to four weeks, until it has the sourness you're looking for.
    - desc: Once it tastes like you want it to, close it with a regular lid or put it into a more pourable bottle, and leave it in the fridge for up to a year.
